***Response:***
>My primary source of news comes from my family, friends, and other people I talk to. Since I am a private person, I tend to hide myself from networks and websites that would produce news. My family has a group chat with 100+ family members in it, and they talk a lot. Without fail every single day there is a new "Breaking news" story that one of them shares. Then they proceed to share their opion on it, and after two or three of them comment on it, itends to get polical and starts a mini war.
